Yet Another patternProblem statement
Ninja was playing with her sister to solve a puzzle pattern. However, even after taking several hours, they could not solve the problem.

A value of N is given to them, and they are asked to solve the problem. Since they are stuck for a while, they ask you to solve the problem. Can you help solve this problem?

Example : Pattern for N = 4

Code:
def ninjaPuzzle(n):
    i = 1
    while(i<=n):
            space = 0
            while(space<i-1):
                print(" ",end="")
                space+=1
            j = 1
            while(j<=n-space):
                print("*",end="")

Greatest common divisor
Problem statement
You are given two numbers, ‘X’ and ‘Y’. Your task is to find the greatest common divisor of the given two numbers.

The Greatest Common Divisor of any two integers is the largest number that divides both integers.

For Example:
You are given ‘X’ as 20 and ‘Y’ as 15. The greatest common divisor, which divides both 15 and 20, is 5. Hence the answer is 5.

Code:
def findGcd(x, y):
    i=1
    check = 0
    if x<=y:
        while(i<=x):
            if x%i==0 and y%i==0:
                if i>check:
                    check = i
            i+=1
        print(check)
    elif y<=x:
        while(i<=y):
            if x%i==0 and y%i==0:
                if i>check:
                    check = i
            i+=1
        print(check)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x,y = input().split()
    findGcd(int(x), int(y))
    if i == t-1:
        exit()
